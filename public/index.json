[{"content":"Welcome to my website! My name is Sebastian Sherrah, and I am doctoral student at the Computational Communication Science Lab within the University of Vienna.\nMy research explores two primary areas: firstly, the influence of narrative structures on human perception and understanding; and secondly, what \u0026rsquo;truth\u0026rsquo; means - because we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let the truth get in the way of a good story. On the technical side, my methodological interests centre around computational linguistics, particularly natural language processing, large language models, and their development.\nWhen I have free time, I enjoy gambling for chairs.\nIf any of these things interest you, or you have something that might interest me (such as chairs) please feel free to get in touch. The method is up to you!\n","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/about/","section":"c10r4n","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"1 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/","section":"c10r4n","summary":"","title":"c10r4n","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sebastian-website/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
